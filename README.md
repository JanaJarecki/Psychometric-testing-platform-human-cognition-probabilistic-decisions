# Psychometric Testing Platform - Human Cognition on Probabilistic Decisions
*Also known as risk-sensitive foraging task.*

This project contains a production code for a web-based digital behavioral choice paradigm to test human cognition and cognitice performance in probabilistic situations (also known as decisions under risk). The code integrates with the behavioral economic web plattform otree, but extends otree's functionality to form a full psychometric experimental platform including adaptive designs and randomizations.

# Description
The software aims at investigating human cognition about risk taking. Software allows to flexibly test various hypothesis regarding the topic.

Methodology: uses object-oriented python objects to implement a behavioral choice experiment to collect economic and psychological behavior, which is sometimes considered more valid than direct questionnaires or conjoint analytics methodology.

Designed: python to interface with the behavioral-science toolbox otree.

Measures: behavioral choices as proxy for cognitive processes.
